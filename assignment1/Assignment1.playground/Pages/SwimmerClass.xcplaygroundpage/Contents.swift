# Swimmer class

This work should be done in the Swimmer.swift file that already exists in the project.

The `Swimmer` class is a subcass of the `Athlete` class that provides a more specific implementation of the
`favoriteSport` computed property.

1. The class will override the implementation of the parent `favoriteSport` property by using a computed property that
only specifies a get block which returns `Sport.swimming`.

Remember to enable the related test bundle and run the tests to validate your work.

The next page will describe how to [implement the Cyclist class](@next).
